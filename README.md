# DC-Motor-Speed-Control-Using-AVR
This project demonstrates DC motor speed control using the Atmega328p microcontroller. By utilizing PWM and external interrupts, the system adjusts the motor speed in real-time through push buttons. The design includes key components such as the L293D motor driver, crystal oscillator, and capacitors, ensuring precise speed regulation.
